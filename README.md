# Optim

## assumptions

* when I buy 10%, I do this by buying 10% from everybody in the network who has something
* % of stock bought is % of the value that is in the network (so not total value --> still inconsistencies)
* there is no ownership cutoff of 50% or anything like that
* implementation only for Vitali for now

## issues

* vitali implementation might use different idea of ownership when not all stock is available
